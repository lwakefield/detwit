This project was built as a way of taking [Deno](https://deno.land/) for a test-run. It is a simple twitter clone with the following features:

- make posts (tweets)
- follow other users
- view a feed of posts from users that you follow
- view a feed of another user
- react to posts

Additionally, I wanted to try something old: the application has no client-side javascript.
